### Dockerized SQL Server Metadata Tableau example

This is an example Tableau visual using SQL Server metadata to build an interactive 'data dictionary' based purely on database metadata.

This particular example uses SQL Server, but is generalizeable to all database types.

In order to get my hands on some 'real' metadata, I built SQL Server 2018 using Docker.

Some resources I was following:
